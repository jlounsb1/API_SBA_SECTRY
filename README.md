# API_SBA_SECTRY


I made a small selection game using the dog API.  There are two pictures with an interface which allows you to pick from one of two dogs.  Each dog will be part of a "team", and will increase that counter by one, then display the updated score to the Dom.  When one team reaches 10, they "win", and the game gets reset.

I also introduced a breed selector at the bottom. I used fetch to import the breeds in the API, then gave the users the option of picking a breed from a drop down and displaying them.

I will be using fetch instead of axios, as instructed.
