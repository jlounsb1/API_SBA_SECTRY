# API_SBA_SECTRY


I want to make a small selection game using the dog API.  I will set up two pictures with an interface which allows you to pick from one of two dogs.  Each dog will be part of a "team", and will increase that counter by one, then display the updated score to the Dom.  

I plan to also add a breed selector at the top. I want the default to not include this, but it would be a nice to have.

When the counter on one team reaches 10, I could add a little team " " wins message and reset.

I will be using fetch instead of axios, as instructed.
