# API_SBA_SECTRY


I made a small selection game using the dog API.  There are two pictures with an interface which allows you to pick from one of two dogs.  Each dog will be part of a "team", and will increase that counter by one, then display the updated score to the Dom.  When one team reaches 10, they "win", and the game gets reset.

I plan to also add a breed selector at the top. I was able to get a breed selection drop down to populate, but I could not get that to properly interact with another API pull to just pull that specfic breed. My attempt at the code is commented out.

I will be using fetch instead of axios, as instructed.
